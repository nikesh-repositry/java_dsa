                  DSA IN JAVA
           --------1.ARRAYS-------
A array is a data structure which is fixed sized ordered collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
>>>Properties:
Contiguous memory allocation: array stores elements in consecutive memory locations, enabling O(1) access time via index-based addressing. For primitive types, the array stores actual values; for reference types, it stores memory addresses (reference) to objects.
Fixed sized
Zero-based indexing
Homogeneous elements 
Length property
Default initialization
Random access in O(1) time 

>Why? Is array => consider that if you have to store data of any packages stored in serial manner then it can be feasible to store in array as based on index it can be retrieve update easily and many other features available.

>>>>declaration and initialization;
There are more than one way to declare an array in java
There are more than one way to declare an array in java
Way1:
Declaration only: you declare a variable that will hold an array of datatype but the size of the array isnâ€™t defined.
Way2;
Declaration and instantiation: here you do both declare as well as create an array object of a specific size using new keyword. The elements are initialized to their default values (0 for numeric, false for Boolean, null for object reference).
Way3;
Declaration, instantiation, and initialization with values;
You declare the array and its sized is automatically determined by the number of elements you provide within the curly braces{}.
Way4;
Declaration and then instantiation: you declare an array variable first and then, at a later point in your code, create the actual array object and assign it to the variable.

>>TYPES OF ARRAYS:
Single dimensional array= Stores elements in a linear format (one row).
int[] arr = new int[5]; // Declaration
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};  // Initialization
multi dimensional array=represents data in rows and columns, accessed via multiple indices.
int[][] matrix = new int[3][3]; // 2D array
int[][] jagged = new int[3][];  // Jagged array (rows with varying columns)

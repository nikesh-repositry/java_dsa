DSA IN JAVA
 ARRAYS 
A array is a data structure which is fixed sized ordered collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
>>>Properties:
Contiguous memory allocation: array stores elements in consecutive memory locations, enabling O(1) access time via index-based addressing. For primitive types, the array stores actual values; for reference types, it stores memory addresses (reference) to objects.
Fixed sized
Zero-based indexing
Homogeneous elements
Length property
Default initialization
Random access in O(1) time 

>Why? Is array => consider that if you have to store data of any packages stored in serial manner then it can be feasible to store in array as based on index it can be retrieve update easily and many other features available.

>>>>declaration and initialization
There are more than one way to declare an array in java
Declaration syntax:
type[] arrayName; // Preferred eg. int[] numbers;
// or
type arrayName[]; // Less common eg. String[] names;

initialization syntax:
first way using new operator:
numbers = new int[5]; // Creates an array of 5 integers, initialized to 0
names = new String[3]; // Creates an array of 3 Strings, initialized to null
second way is direct initialization:
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initializes with specific values
String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"};

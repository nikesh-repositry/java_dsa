ARRAYS --------------------------------------------------------------
A array is a data structure which is fixed sized ordered collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
Properties:
Contiguous memory allocation: array stores elements in consecutive memory locations, enabling O(1) access time via index-based addressing. For primitive types, the array stores actual values; for reference types, it stores memory addresses (reference) to objects.
Fixed sized
Zero-based indexing
Homogeneous elements
